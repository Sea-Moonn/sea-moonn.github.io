About me:
======
  Hi! I am currently an undergraduate student at Southwest University (SWU), where I researched NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) and low-level vision tasks. I’ve recently been admitted to Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU) as a postgraduate student, 2025 fall, where I will focus on LLMs for software engineering. 
  
I am very interested in **3D vision and LLMs**, and I believe these two fields will be essential foundations for AGI. I look forward to their combination in the coming years! Let’s achieve AGI together!
